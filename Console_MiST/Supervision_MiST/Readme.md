# Watara Supervision for MiST
Based upon initial work by Pierco, rewritten by Jamie Blanks.

Usage

Start = ESC
Select = TAB
A = Control
B = LALT

An implementation of the unfortunate GameBoy clone, the Watara SuperVision. No boot ROMs are required and there is no additional setup.


The full game library is supported, including the rare "Journey to the West".

## Special Thanks
A special thank you to Osman Celimli for his very thorough reverse engineering notes and personal help in getting this core accurate.
