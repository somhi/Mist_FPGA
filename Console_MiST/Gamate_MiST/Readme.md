# Gamate Handheld System for MiST

Usage

Start = ESC
Select = TAB
A = Control
B = LALT

## General description
This is an FPGA implementation of the Gamate handheld system by Jamie Blanks. This was a Gameboy clone from the early 2000's from the Bit Corp, later to be part of UMC. There's not much to say about it.

You may copy a game to boot1.rom in order to have it boot to that game when the core loads.

## Special Thanks
Thanks to Moondandy for thorough testing and bug hunting.
